## Deep Learning Project <!-- omit in toc -->
This project involved the building of a fully convolutional network (FCN) to which was trained to identify a target individual from a simulated drone camera feed.

The model is built within Tensorflow and Keras, and was trained using a p2.xlarge AWS EC2 instance.

The original Udacity project repo is here.
